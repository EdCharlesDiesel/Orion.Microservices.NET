        /// string and returns it's run-length encoding.
        /// From Wikipedia, "run-length encoding is a form
        /// of lossless data compression in which runs of
        /// data are stored as a single data value and count
        /// rather than as the original run". For this problem,
        /// a run of data is any sequence consecutive, identical
        /// characters. So the run "AAA" would be run-length-encoded
        /// as "3A".
        /// 
        /// To make things more complicated, however, the input string
        /// can contain all sorts of special characters, including numbers
        /// And since encoded data must be decodable, this means that
        /// we can't naively run-length-encode long runs. For example,
        /// the run "AAAAAAAAAAAA" (12A)s, can naively be decoded as "12A"
        /// sinc this string can be decoded as either "AAAAAAAAAAAA" or
        /// "1AA". Thus, long runs(runs of 10 or more characters) should
        /// be encoded in a split fashion; the aforementioned run should be
        /// encoded as "9A3A".
